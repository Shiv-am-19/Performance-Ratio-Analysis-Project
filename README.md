# 📊 Performance Ratio (PR) Analysis Using Python

**📝 Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing the Performance Ratio (PR) of solar energy systems using GHI (Global Horizontal Irradiance) and Date as supporting parameters. The analysis was done using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment to understand system efficiency trends over time.

**📁 Dataset**

The dataset used contains three main columns:

Date: Time series data for observations

GHI: Global Horizontal Irradiance values (W/m²)

PR: Performance Ratio, a key metric to evaluate solar plant efficiency

✅ The dataset is clean – with no null or missing values.

**⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used**

Python (Jupyter Notebook)

pandas

matplotlib / seaborn

numpy

**📌 Key Features**

Data preprocessing and validation

Time-series trend analysis of PR and GHI

Visualization of PR performance over time

Comparison of PR against GHI to evaluate system efficiency

**📈 Output**

The project outputs include:

A cleaned .csv file with verified data

Visual graphs showing PR trends

Analytical insights based on seasonal or daily performance patterns

**🚀 How to Run**

Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook

Ensure required libraries are installed (pandas, matplotlib, etc.)

Run the notebook cell by cell to reproduce the analysis and visualizations
